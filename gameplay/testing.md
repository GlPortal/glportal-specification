Testing elements
----------------

-   Portals
    -   See how it keeps forward momentum, *or*, *to be more precise*,
        *how it does not*.
-   Boxes
    -   Constructed in-place (materialization or assembly, the latter is
        harder to animate but way cooler)
-   Lasers
    -   Red laser is for the weak, has long wavelength (= low energy).
        Give us blue/purple lasers!
    -   Can have speed of light OR be slowed down by emitter (see
        upcoming 3D model)
    -   Purple lasers are lethal and can be used to (willingly) damage
        things, whereas blue ones are not (both can be, of course, used
        to activate laser receivers)
-   Laser redirection boxes
-   Buttons
    -   Player activated (small button)
    -   Box activated
-   Catapults
    -   Target
-   Fizzlers
    -   Portal-only
    -   Object-only
    -   Both
    -   Visible action surface (another Simplex Noise?) / volume edge
    -   Edges visible and surrounded by wall-tied emitters
        -   Might be sticking out of the wall or part of it
