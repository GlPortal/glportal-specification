# GlPortal Specification
This is the specification for [GlPortal](https://github.com/GlPortal/glPortal).
The purpose of this document is to describe the features for GlPortal.

## Game Type and General Mechanics
GlPortal is a first-person action game with puzzle elements.

The player is equipped with a teleportation device that can place both ends of a teleporter.
Portals can be placed on special surfaces on walls, floors and ceilings.

In order to keep the player emersed instead of allowing the player to save continiously there are specific checkpoints in the game where the player can save his progress. There are also certain points where the progress is saved automatically.

Checkpoints are supposed to be rare so that the fear of dying creates some real tension. And to help the player not fall into the practice of saving every few seconds.
